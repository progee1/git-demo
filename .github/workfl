# GitHub Actions Workflow for a React Application
# This workflow builds and tests the application across multiple Node.js versions.

name: React CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the main/master branch
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events targeting the main/master branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  build_and_test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      # Defines a matrix of configurations to run the job with
      # In this case, it will run the job three times, once for each Node.js version
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x, 18.x, 20.x]
        # You can add other matrix variables here if needed, e.g., different operating systems
        # os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]

    name: Build & Test on Node ${{ matrix.node-version }} # Dynamically set the job name

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      # This action checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Uses the official checkout action

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      # This action sets up a Node.js environment for use in actions.
      # It will use the Node.js version specified in the matrix.
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm' # Or 'yarn' if you use Yarn. This caches dependencies for faster builds.

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # This command installs the project dependencies.
      # 'npm ci' is generally recommended for CI environments as it's faster and more reliable
      # for reproducing builds than 'npm install'. It requires a package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json.
      # If you use Yarn, replace this with 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile'.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        # Or for Yarn:
        # run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      # Step 4: Build the React application
      # This command compiles the React application for production.
      # The specific command might vary based on your project setup (e.g., create-react-app, Next.js, Vite).
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
        # Or for Yarn:
        # run: yarn build
        env:
          CI: true # Often used by build scripts to adjust behavior for CI environments

      # Step 5: Run tests
      # This command executes the test suite for your application.
      # The specific command might vary.
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        # Or for Yarn:
        # run: yarn test
        env:
          CI: true # Ensures tests run in CI mode (e.g., not watching for changes)

      # Optional Step 6: Upload build artifacts (if needed)
      # If you need to inspect the build output or use it in a later deployment job.
      # - name: Upload build artifact
      #   uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      #   with:
      #     name: build-output-${{ matrix.node-version }} # Unique name for artifact from each Node version
      #     path: build/ # Or your project's build output directory
